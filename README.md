# BullvsBearBeta
I got the idea for this project on instagram of all places, and thought it sounded interesting, so I decided to give it a try. Essentially, it examines beta, which is a measure of how sensitive a stock is to the performance of the market. I break beta down into bear and bull beta, which is how sensitive a stock is when the market is going down or up, respectively. Overall, you could use this concept to create a defensive portfolio, focusing on companies with low bear betas, mainly consisting of consumer defensive and utility companies, or go the opposite way and focus on companies with high bull betas.
